Git tips:
Always pull before doing any push to do a merge if necessary.
When implementing major features, consider branching.

The map should only be loaded when testing ther map itself to
avoid going over the API request limit.

index.html currently only imports script.js from our local directory.
I've been creating this file on-demand when need be (when testing)
by combining all working js files. I do this using the following
commands:

rm script.js
cat *.js > script.js
