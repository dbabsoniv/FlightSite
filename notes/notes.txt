Database Notes:

Do not make any PUT requests to airlines, airports, flights, and
planes.

The database I collected from distinguished Endeavor Air from
Delta, but didn't do that for any other regional carriers. Thus
this edge case could be easily handled and it's handled in a rather
brute-force manner.
Endeavor Air shouldn't be shown as an airline. It should be shown as
an operator of a Delta flight.
The Flight object understands this and has been designed to handle
this.

Git tips:

Always pull before doing any push to do a merge if necessary.
When implementing major features, consider branching.

What is script.js?

index.html currently only imports script.js from our local directory.
I've been creating this file on-demand when need be (when testing)
by combining all working js files. I do this using the following
terminal commands, which should work on a Mac:

rm script.js
cat *.js > script.js

--------------------
Implementation Notes:

While building the database timezones were too difficult to
implement. Thus both departure AND arrival times are in the timezone
of the departure city.
There are libraries that translate Lat/Longs into a time zone if we
want to go that route.
Regardless we need to come to some sort of plan with the times,
which may just be using what is in the database.

Should there be some sort of guide to the website using a "?" icon?
Just an idea.

General Notes:

Robert refers to himself as REPIII in code comments, if that
weren't already obvious...

REPIII cannot spell the word "departure". This has literally caused
hours of bugs lol just a heads up for future bugs.
