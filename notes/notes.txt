Database Notes:

Do not make any PUT requests to airlines, airports, flights, and
planes. These resources should never be added to.

The database I collected from distinguished Endeavor Air from
Delta, but didn't do that for any other regional carriers. Thus
this edge case could be easily handled and it's handled in a rather
brute-force manner.
Endeavor Air shouldn't be shown as an airline. It should be shown as
an operator of a Delta flight.
The Flight object understands this and has been designed to handle
this case.

ID Ranges (Inclusive):
AIRLINE ID RANGE: [66, 107]
AIRPORT ID RANGE: [1465, 1982] THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS
FLIGHT ID RANGE: [1836, 18691]
PLANE ID RANGE: [63, 113]
AIRPORT IDs DELETED: {
1479, 1496, 1528, 1534, 1549, 1567, 1594, 1669, 1520, 1556, 1580,
1613, 1643, 1664, 1527, 1530, 1542, 1551, 1605, 1608, 1620, 1644,
1693, 1717, 1768, 1751, 1766, 1814, 1823, 1752, 1827, 1872, 1897,
1899, 1902, 1912, 1918, 1921, 1948, 1959
}

Git tips:

Always pull before doing any push to do a merge if necessary.
When implementing major features, consider branching.

------
What is script.js?:

index.html currently only imports script.js from our local directory.
I've been creating this file on-demand when need be (when testing)
by combining all working js files. I do this using the following
terminal commands, which should work on a Mac:

rm script.js
cat *.js > script.js

Since it's a temporary file, I've excluded it from our git
respository so we don't push it along with everthing else.

--------------------
Implementation Notes:

While building the database timezones were too difficult to
implement. Thus both departure AND arrival times are in the timezone
of the departure city.
There are libraries that translate Lat/Longs into a time zone if we
want to go that route.
Regardless we need to come to some sort of plan with the times,
which may just be using what is in the database.

Should there be some sort of guide to the website using a "?" icon?
Just an idea.

The database interface currently doesn't support ticket prices, but
will eventually. The front end should support ticket prices once the
database interface gets its stuff together.

Ticket panel should be animated in a similar way to the way the
Itinerary panel is, just without the hover.

General Notes:

Robert refers to himself as REPIII in code comments, if that
weren't already obvious...

Do not push the database username and password ever.
Creating the database takes time. We don't need an asshole deleting
our database.

REPIII cannot spell the words "departure" and "success". This has
literally caused hours of bugs lol just a heads up for future bugs.

airports_id_by_airlines.csv and airports_id_by_flights.csv reflect
the current database. They do not include the airports that had no
flights that were removed from the database
